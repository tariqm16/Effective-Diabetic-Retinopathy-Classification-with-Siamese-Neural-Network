Python Code for Effective Diabetic Retinopathy Classification with Siamese Neural Network: A Strategy for Small Dataset Challenges

The requirements.txt file should list all Python libraries that your notebooks depend on, and they will be installed using:

<code>```pip install -r requirements.txt```</code>

Two Datasets have been used in this paper: the FGADR dataset and Aptos 2019 Blindness Detection.
The FGADR dataset has fine-grained annotations on 1842 fundus images with pixel- and image-level labels. The dataset is taken from the
UAE hospitals and is the property of the Inception Institute of Artificial Intelligence, Abu Dhabi. I
The sample images from the dataset with lesion details are given below:
